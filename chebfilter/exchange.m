function [xk, norme, err_handle, flag] = exchange(xk, h, method, f, p, q, Npts, freqs)
%EXCHANGE   Modify an equioscillation reference using the Remez algorithm.
%   EXCHANGE(XK, H, METHOD, F, P, Q) performs one step of the Remez algorithm
%   for the best rational approximation of the CHEBFUN F of the target function
%   according to the first method (METHOD = 1), i.e. exchanges only one point,
%   or the second method (METHOD = 2), i.e. exchanges all the reference points.
%   XK is a column vector with the reference, H is the levelled error, P is the
%   numerator, and Q is the denominator of the trial rational function P/Q.
%
%   [XK, NORME, E_HANDLE, FLAG] = EXCHANGE(...) returns the modified reference
%   XK, the supremum norm of the error NORME (included as an output argument,
%   since it is readily computed in EXCHANGE and is used later in REMEZ), a
%   function handle E_HANDLE for the error, and a FLAG indicating whether there
%   were at least N+2 alternating extrema of the error to form the next
%   reference (FLAG = 1) or not (FLAG = 0).
%
%   [XK, ...] = EXCHANGE([], 0, METHOD, F, P, Q, N + 2) returns a grid of N + 2
%   points XK where the error F - P/Q alternates in sign (but not necessarily
%   equioscillates). This feature of EXCHANGE is useful to start REMEZ from an
%   initial trial function rather than an initial trial reference.
