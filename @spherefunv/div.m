function f = div( f )
%DIV   Numerical surface divergence of a SPHEREFUNV. 
%   D = DIVERGENCE( F ) returns the numerical surface divergence of the
%   SPHEREFUNV. This operations only makes mathematical sense for F that
%   are tanget to the sphere.
%
%  This is shorthand for the command DIVERGENCE. 
% 
% See also DIVERGENCE, GRAD, CURL.
