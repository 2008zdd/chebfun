function f = fliplr(f) %#ok<INUSD>
%FLIPLR   Flip columns of an array-valued SINGFUN object. Since SINGFUN does not
%support array-valued SINGFUN which has more than one column, what it returns
%will the input SINGFUN itself.
%
%   FLIPLR(F) flips the columns of an array-valued CHEBTECH in the left/right
%   direction. Since F has to be of one column, this function has no effect.
