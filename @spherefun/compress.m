function f = compress( f, flag )
% COMPRESS     Compress the rank of a spherefun
% 
%  F = COMPRESS( F ), use the SVD to compress the rank of a spherefun. 
%
%  F = COMPRESS( F, 1), does a much faster compression. It only compresses
%  the pivot matrix.  It does not look for linearly independent in the
%  columns or rows.
