function out = sum(g)
%SUM   Definite integral of a UNBNDFUN on singly- or doubly-infinite domain.
%    SUM(G) is the definite integral of G, whose domain can be either singly-
%    infinite or doubly-infinite.

g.onefun = cancelExponents(g.onefun);

% Get the function values at the end of the domain. Note that the end point of
% the domain can be infinite.

% Get the epslevel and vscale of the function g.

% Check 1: Check if the function values are vanishing at infinity/ies.

    % g.onefun is a CHEBTECH, and, even then, the idea that it "works" is merely
    % heuristic; there's no a priori reason that it should. We really would like
    % to do an adaptive construction, but the fact that the nonlinear map
    % compresses very wide intervals near +/-Inf into very small ones near +/-1,
    % means that the filtered function produced by unbndfunIntegrand() will
    % appear to exhibit sharp transitions to zero when sampled on a Chebyshev
    % grid of the usual sizes, causing the constructor to fail. Until we can
    % solve this problem there doesn't seem to be much else we can do here.

%UNBNDFUNINTEGRAND   Compute the integrand in the integral of an UNBNDFUN.
%   Y = UNBNDFUNINTEGRAND(X, G) evaluates at X the mapped integrand with the
%   chain rule applied when one goes to compute the integral of G, i.e., it
%   computes G(X).*G.MAPPING.DER(X).  Values of G less than a tolerance are
%   set to zero.  This filtering is applied to avoid problems with round-off
%   error in G near infinite endpoints being amplified by the derivative of the
%   map, which is large there.
%
%   This function is meant to be used to create a ONEFUN for the integrand,
%   which can then be integrated with the ONEFUN's implementation of SUM.
